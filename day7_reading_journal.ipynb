You start off with sprite, you take a letter off, one from the interior of the word, take the r away, and we’re left with the word spite, then we take the e off the end, we’re left with spit, we take the s off, we’re left with pit, it, and I. \n",

    "This exercise is a little more challenging than most, so here are some suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You might want to write a function that takes a word and computes a list of all the words that can be formed by removing one letter. These are the “children” of the word.\n",
    "- Recursively, a word is reducible if any of its children are reducible. As a base case, you can consider the empty string reducible.\n",
    "- The word list from [Chapter 9.1](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython010.html) Exercise 1 doesn’t contain single letter words. So you might want to add “I”, “a”, and the empty string.\n",
    "- To improve the performance of your program, you might want to memoize the words that are known to be reducible.\n",
